# OOPS Banner APP - UC3 (String Join Implementation)

## Overview
This Java application renders an "OOPS" banner in the console using the `String.join()` method, replacing inefficient string concatenation from UC2. The goal is to improve memory efficiency by avoiding multiple intermediate String objects created during concatenation.

## Key Improvements from UC2
- **Memory Efficiency**: `String.join()` creates a single StringBuilder internally instead of multiple immutable String objects.
- **Modularity**: Cleaner, more readable code structure.
- **Reusability**: Line construction logic can be easily extended or modified.
